### Abstract

WARHeads is a prediction engine that gathers NBA Data, parses it and processes it and generates win probabilites via various methods such as ELO. It also does analysis for the NFL and basic analytics for the MLB Wins Above Replacement statistics.

We will add Formula 1 later to create predictions for F1 based on tracks as well.
